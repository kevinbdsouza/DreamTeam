**Constraints:**
- You must respect the constraints given in the `train_mps.py` file. For example, not changing certain hyperparameters.
- The return values of the `train()` function in `train_mps.py` should be properly configured to be `best_vloss, elapsed_min`.

**Linear Algebra Specialist Approach:**
Now, apply your linear algebra expertise to improve the machine learning model. Focus on:
- Implementing advanced matrix operations and decompositions
- Using spectral properties for optimization
- Applying geometric insights to model design
- Improving numerical stability through linear algebra
- Designing efficient matrix-based algorithms

Make substantial changes to both `train_mps.py` and `model.py` files, ensuring your modifications are:
- Linear algebraically principled and well-founded
- Focused on matrix operations and spectral properties
- Novel and not simply incremental improvements
- Fully compatible with the given constraints

Your goal is to create a model that demonstrates superior linear algebraic properties and numerical stability while maintaining or improving performance.
