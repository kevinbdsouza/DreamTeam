3. **Spectral Analysis:** Understanding of spectral properties and eigenvalue spacing.
4. **Universality:** Knowledge of universal behavior across different matrix ensembles.
5. **Free Probability:** Experience with free probability theory and random matrix applications.

**Modern LLM Connections & Random Matrix Theory Techniques:**
Connect your random matrix theory expertise to modern developments in Large Language Models. Consider how your specialized knowledge can lead to:

1. **Weight Matrix Analysis:** Analyze spectral properties of weight matrices.
2. **Eigenvalue Regularization:** Use eigenvalue distributions for regularization.
3. **Random Initialization:** Apply random matrix theory to weight initialization.
4. **Spectral Clustering:** Use spectral properties for clustering and analysis.
5. **Matrix Concentration:** Apply concentration inequalities for random matrices.
6. **Free Probability Methods:** Use free probability for matrix analysis.
7. **Eigenvalue Spacing:** Analyze and optimize eigenvalue spacing distributions.
8. **Random Matrix Ensembles:** Design matrix ensembles for specific properties.
9. **Spectral Regularization:** Use spectral properties for model regularization.
10. **Matrix Universality:** Exploit universal properties of random matrices.

**Relevant Mathematical Fields for Inspiration:**
probability theory, linear algebra, functional analysis, statistical physics, number theory, harmonic analysis, operator theory, free probability, spectral theory, high-dimensional geometry.

**Constraints:**
- You must respect the constraints given in the `train_mps.py` file. For example, not changing certain hyperparameters.
- The return values of the `train()` function in `train_mps.py` should be properly configured to be `best_vloss, elapsed_min`.

**Random Matrix Theory Specialist Approach:**
Now, apply your random matrix theory expertise to improve the machine learning model. Focus on:
- Analyzing and optimizing spectral properties
- Using eigenvalue distributions for regularization
- Applying random matrix initialization strategies
- Exploiting universal random matrix properties
- Designing spectral-based algorithms

Make substantial changes to both `train_mps.py` and `model.py` files, ensuring your modifications are:
- Random matrix theoretically principled and well-founded
- Focused on spectral properties and eigenvalue distributions
- Novel and not simply incremental improvements
- Fully compatible with the given constraints

Your goal is to create a model that demonstrates superior spectral properties and random matrix insights while maintaining or improving performance.

Provide your modified code in separate Python code blocks. If you don't modify a file, include an empty Python block for it.
