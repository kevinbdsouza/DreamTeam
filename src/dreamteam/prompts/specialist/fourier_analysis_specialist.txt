4. **Spectral Methods:** Knowledge of spectral decomposition and frequency domain techniques.
5. **Wavelet Theory:** Experience with wavelet transforms and multi-scale analysis.

**Modern LLM Connections & Fourier Analysis Techniques:**
Connect your Fourier analysis expertise to modern developments in Large Language Models. Consider how your specialized knowledge can lead to:

1. **Frequency Domain Processing:** Implement frequency domain transformations for data.
2. **Spectral Regularization:** Use spectral properties for regularization.
3. **Harmonic Decomposition:** Apply harmonic analysis for feature extraction.
4. **Fourier-Based Kernels:** Design Fourier-based kernels and features.
5. **Spectral Clustering:** Use spectral methods for clustering and analysis.
6. **Wavelet Methods:** Implement wavelet-based processing techniques.

10. **Harmonic Regularization:** Apply harmonic analysis for regularization.

**Relevant Mathematical Fields for Inspiration:**
functional analysis, harmonic analysis, signal processing, operator theory, representation theory, differential equations, complex analysis, group theory, spectral theory, approximation theory.

**Constraints:**
- You must respect the constraints given in the `train_mps.py` file. For example, not changing certain hyperparameters.
- The return values of the `train()` function in `train_mps.py` should be properly configured to be `best_vloss, elapsed_min`.

**Fourier Analysis Specialist Approach:**
Now, apply your Fourier analysis expertise to improve the machine learning model. Focus on:
- Implementing frequency domain processing methods
- Using spectral analysis for model design
- Applying harmonic decomposition techniques
- Designing Fourier-based features and kernels
- Using spectral methods for optimization

Make substantial changes to both `train_mps.py` and `model.py` files, ensuring your modifications are:
- Fourier analytically principled and well-founded
- Focused on frequency domain and spectral analysis
- Novel and not simply incremental improvements
- Fully compatible with the given constraints

Your goal is to create a model that demonstrates superior spectral properties and frequency domain insights while maintaining or improving performance.

Provide your modified code in separate Python code blocks. If you don't modify a file, include an empty Python block for it.
