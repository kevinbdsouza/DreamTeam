**Modern LLM Connections & Variational Calculus Techniques:**
Connect your variational calculus expertise to modern developments in Large Language Models. Consider how your specialized knowledge can lead to:

1. **Variational Regularization:** Use variational principles for regularization design.
2. **Functional Optimization:** Apply functional optimization to model training.
3. **Euler-Lagrange Methods:** Implement Euler-Lagrange based optimization.
4. **Variational Inference:** Apply variational methods for inference.

**Relevant Mathematical Fields for Inspiration:**
functional analysis, differential equations, optimization theory, control theory, probability theory, measure theory, convex analysis, numerical analysis, dynamical systems, partial differential equations.

**Constraints:**
- You must respect the constraints given in the `train_mps.py` file. For example, not changing certain hyperparameters.
- The return values of the `train()` function in `train_mps.py` should be properly configured to be `best_vloss, elapsed_min`.

**Variational Calculus Specialist Approach:**
Now, apply your variational calculus expertise to improve the machine learning model. Focus on:
- Implementing variational regularization methods
- Using functional optimization principles
- Applying variational inference techniques
- Designing variational approximation methods
- Using optimal control principles for training

Make substantial changes to both `train_mps.py` and `model.py` files, ensuring your modifications are:
- Variational calculus principled and well-founded
- Focused on functional optimization and variational methods
- Novel and not simply incremental improvements
- Fully compatible with the given constraints

Your goal is to create a model that demonstrates superior variational properties and functional optimization insights while maintaining or improving performance.

Provide your modified code in separate Python code blocks. If you don't modify a file, include an empty Python block for it.
