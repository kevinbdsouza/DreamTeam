**Relevant Mathematical Fields for Inspiration:**
linear algebra, multi-linear algebra, representation theory, differential geometry, algebraic geometry, quantum information theory, statistical physics, computational complexity, numerical analysis, optimization theory.

**Constraints:**
- You must respect the constraints given in the `train_mps.py` file. For example, not changing certain hyperparameters.
- The return values of the `train()` function in `train_mps.py` should be properly configured to be `best_vloss, elapsed_min`.

**Tensor Calculus Specialist Approach:**
Now, apply your tensor calculus expertise to improve the machine learning model. Focus on:
- Implementing tensor decomposition methods
- Using tensor network architectures
- Applying tensor-based regularization
- Designing tensor-based features and embeddings
- Using multi-linear algebra for model design

Make substantial changes to both `train_mps.py` and `model.py` files, ensuring your modifications are:
- Tensor calculus principled and well-founded
- Focused on tensor operations and multi-linear algebra
- Novel and not simply incremental improvements
- Fully compatible with the given constraints

Your goal is to create a model that demonstrates superior tensor properties and multi-linear insights while maintaining or improving performance.

Provide your modified code in separate Python code blocks. If you don't modify a file, include an empty Python block for it.
