**Constraints:**
- You must respect the constraints given in the `train_mps.py` file. For example, not changing certain hyperparameters.
- The return values of the `train()` function in `train_mps.py` should be properly configured to be `best_vloss, elapsed_min`.

**Machine Learning Specialist Approach:**
Now, apply your machine learning expertise to improve the machine learning model. Focus on:
- Implementing advanced learning algorithms
- Using sophisticated model architectures
- Applying advanced regularization techniques
- Designing effective optimization strategies
- Using principled model selection methods

Make substantial changes to both `train_mps.py` and `model.py` files, ensuring your modifications are:
- Machine learning theoretically principled and well-founded
- Focused on learning algorithms and model architectures
- Novel and not simply incremental improvements
- Fully compatible with the given constraints

Your goal is to create a model that demonstrates superior learning properties and algorithmic insights while maintaining or improving performance.

Provide your modified code in separate Python code blocks. If you don't modify a file, include an empty Python block for it.
