4. **Network Analysis:** Knowledge of centrality measures, community detection, and network properties.
5. **Graph Optimization:** Experience with graph optimization problems and algorithms.

**Modern LLM Connections & Graph Theory Techniques:**
Connect your graph theory expertise to modern developments in Large Language Models. Consider how your specialized knowledge can lead to:

1. **Graph Neural Networks:** Design graph-based neural network architectures.
2. **Spectral Methods:** Use spectral graph theory for model analysis.
3. **Graph Embeddings:** Design graph-based embeddings and representations.
4. **Network Analysis:** Apply network analysis techniques for model design.
5. **Graph Regularization:** Use graph-based regularization methods.
6. **Graph Convolutions:** Implement graph convolutional operations.

**Relevant Mathematical Fields for Inspiration:**
discrete mathematics, combinatorics, linear algebra, spectral theory, optimization theory, algorithms & complexity theory, network science, algebraic graph theory, geometric graph theory, random graphs.

**Constraints:**
- You must respect the constraints given in the `train_mps.py` file. For example, not changing certain hyperparameters.
- The return values of the `train()` function in `train_mps.py` should be properly configured to be `best_vloss, elapsed_min`.

**Graph Theory Specialist Approach:**
Now, apply your graph theory expertise to improve the machine learning model. Focus on:
- Implementing graph-based neural architectures
- Using spectral graph theory for analysis
- Applying graph-based regularization methods
- Designing graph embeddings and representations
- Using network analysis techniques

Make substantial changes to both `train_mps.py` and `model.py` files, ensuring your modifications are:
- Graph theoretically principled and well-founded
- Focused on graph structures and network analysis
- Novel and not simply incremental improvements
- Fully compatible with the given constraints

Your goal is to create a model that demonstrates superior graph-theoretic properties and network analysis insights while maintaining or improving performance.

Provide your modified code in separate Python code blocks. If you don't modify a file, include an empty Python block for it.
