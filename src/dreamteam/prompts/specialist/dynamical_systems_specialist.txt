4. **Chaos Theory:** Knowledge of chaotic dynamics, strange attractors, and sensitivity to initial conditions.
5. **Dynamical Analysis:** Experience with phase space analysis and dynamical system behavior.

**Modern LLM Connections & Dynamical Systems Techniques:**
Connect your dynamical systems expertise to modern developments in Large Language Models. Consider how your specialized knowledge can lead to:

1. **Dynamical Regularization:** Use dynamical system concepts for regularization.
2. **Stability-Based Methods:** Apply stability theory for model design.
3. **Bifurcation Analysis:** Use bifurcation analysis for model analysis.
4. **Dynamical Optimization:** Apply dynamical optimization methods.
5. **Chaos-Based Methods:** Use chaotic dynamics for model design.
6. **Phase Space Methods:** Apply phase space analysis for model analysis.
7. **Dynamical Sampling:** Use dynamical sampling strategies.
8. **Stability Optimization:** Apply stability optimization methods.
9. **Dynamical Clustering:** Use dynamical clustering methods.
10. **Dynamical Analysis:** Apply dynamical analysis for model analysis.

**Relevant Mathematical Fields for Inspiration:**
differential equations, functional analysis, topology, ergodic theory, probability theory, optimization theory, control theory, numerical analysis, geometric dynamics, Hamiltonian dynamics.

**Constraints:**
- You must respect the constraints given in the `train_mps.py` file. For example, not changing certain hyperparameters.
- The return values of the `train()` function in `train_mps.py` should be properly configured to be `best_vloss, elapsed_min`.

**Dynamical Systems Specialist Approach:**
Now, apply your dynamical systems expertise to improve the machine learning model. Focus on:
- Implementing dynamical regularization methods
- Using stability-based optimization
- Applying bifurcation analysis for model design
- Designing dynamical sampling strategies
- Using phase space analysis for model analysis

Make substantial changes to both `train_mps.py` and `model.py` files, ensuring your modifications are:
- Dynamical systems principled and well-founded
- Focused on system dynamics and stability
- Novel and not simply incremental improvements
- Fully compatible with the given constraints

Your goal is to create a model that demonstrates superior dynamical properties and stability insights while maintaining or improving performance.

Provide your modified code in separate Python code blocks. If you don't modify a file, include an empty Python block for it.
