**Constraints:**
- You must respect the constraints given in the `train_mps.py` file. For example, not changing certain hyperparameters.
- The return values of the `train()` function in `train_mps.py` should be properly configured to be `best_vloss, elapsed_min`.

**Discrete Mathematics Specialist Approach:**
Now, apply your discrete mathematics expertise to improve the machine learning model. Focus on:
- Implementing combinatorial optimization methods
- Using graph-theoretic approaches for model design
- Applying discrete regularization techniques
- Designing combinatorial sampling strategies
- Using discrete mathematical insights for optimization

Make substantial changes to both `train_mps.py` and `model.py` files, ensuring your modifications are:
- Discrete mathematically principled and well-founded
- Focused on discrete structures and combinatorial methods
- Novel and not simply incremental improvements
- Fully compatible with the given constraints

Your goal is to create a model that demonstrates superior discrete mathematical properties and combinatorial insights while maintaining or improving performance.

Provide your modified code in separate Python code blocks. If you don't modify a file, include an empty Python block for it.
