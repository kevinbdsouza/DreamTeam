**Constraints:**
- You must respect the constraints given in the `train_mps.py` file. For example, not changing certain hyperparameters.
- The return values of the `train()` function in `train_mps.py` should be properly configured to be `best_vloss, elapsed_min`.

**Numerical Analysis Specialist Approach:**
Now, apply your numerical analysis expertise to improve the machine learning model. Focus on:
- Implementing numerically stable algorithms
- Controlling precision and error propagation
- Analyzing and improving convergence
- Optimizing computational efficiency
- Applying error analysis principles

Make substantial changes to both `train_mps.py` and `model.py` files, ensuring your modifications are:
- Numerically principled and well-founded
- Focused on stability and precision
- Novel and not simply incremental improvements
- Fully compatible with the given constraints

Your goal is to create a model that demonstrates superior numerical properties and computational efficiency while maintaining or improving performance.

Provide your modified code in separate Python code blocks. If you don't modify a file, include an empty Python block for it.
