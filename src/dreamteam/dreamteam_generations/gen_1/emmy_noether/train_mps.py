    # From Emmy Noether's perspective:
    # Let us consider the "conservation law" of our optimization process.
    # A constant learning rate might lead to a system that oscillates or stalls.
    # By introducing a dynamic learning rate, particularly one with a smooth decay
    # like cosine annealing, we ensure a more stable and "symmetrical" convergence path.
    # The initial "warmup" phase allows the system to explore the parameter space,
    # while the "cosine decay" ensures a graceful reduction in the "energy" of updates,
    # leading to a more refined solution that respects the underlying "symmetries" of the loss landscape.

    # Also, regarding the "ring" of weights, an overly strong weight decay (0.1) might
    # prematurely constrain the "ideals" (features) the network can form.
    # A slightly weaker decay might allow for a richer, more expressive "algebraic structure" of parameters.
    # Let's adjust these.

    # This can be seen as a smooth, predictable evolution of the system's "energy" (learning rate)
    # ensuring stability and convergence while allowing for initial exploration.
